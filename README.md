# Arduino-Fundamentals
This repository contains the fundamentals of Arduino and demonstrates how to apply them in practical projects. It is designed to help beginners understand the core concepts of Arduino programming, circuit building, and real-world applications through simple, step-by-step examples.

Here, you’ll find explanations of basic components, common functions, and clear sample codes that you can upload directly to your Arduino board. Each example focuses on building your confidence and creativity while learning how sensors, LEDs, and other electronic elements work together.

Whether you’re a student, hobbyist, or someone just starting out with electronics, this repository will guide you through the exciting journey of turning ideas into interactive hardware projects.
# Sample Projects Included 
1. Light up an LED : Learn how to power an LED using Ardunio. Understand digital pins, polarity and write first simple sketch to light up an LED.
2. Blink an LED : Based upon the previous project, make your LED blink automatically using delay() function. This invloves basic coding logic and time control.
3. Working with Motors : Learn how to connect small DC motors using transistors and motor driver modules.
4. Magic of IR sensors : Discover how IR(Infrared) sensors detect objects and distances. You will learn to read sensor data and use it to trigger LEDs or motors.
5. Potentiometers : Use Potentiometers to control speed, brightness or other analog parameters. This project teaches you about analog input and analogRead() function.
6. Bonus Project: Combine the current knowledge and build a mini project.

# How to Use 
1. Download this repository.
2. Open any .ino file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your Arduino Board via USB.
4. Select the correct board and port in IDE.
5. Click upload and watch your circuit come to life.

# Components Required
1. Arduino UNO/NANO/MEGA
2. LEDs and Resistors.
